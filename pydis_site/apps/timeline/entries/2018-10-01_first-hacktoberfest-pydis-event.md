We create a second bot for our community and fill it up with simple, fun and
relatively easy issues. The idea is to create an approachable arena for our
members to cut their open-source teeth on, and to provide lots of help and hand-
holding for those who get stuck. We're training our members to be productive
contributors in the open-source ecosystem.
