We host the 8th now-annual Code Jam. Teams had to create a program with an text-
based user interface (TUI), all designed around the theme of “think inside the
box.” Ultimately, 51 teams submitted projects. [The winning submissions are
listed on our website.](https://www.pythondiscord.com/events/code-jams/8/)
