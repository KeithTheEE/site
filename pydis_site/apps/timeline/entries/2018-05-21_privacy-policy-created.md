Since data privacy is quite important to us, we create a privacy page pretty
much as soon as our new bot and site starts collecting some data. To this day,
we keep [our privacy policy](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/privacy/) up to
date with all changes, and since April 2020 we've started doing [monthly data
reviews](https://pythondiscord.notion.site/6784e3a9752444e89d19e65fd4510d8d).
