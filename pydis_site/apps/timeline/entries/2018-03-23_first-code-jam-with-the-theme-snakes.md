Our very first Code Jam attracts a handful of users who work in random teams of
2. We ask our participants to write a snake-themed Discord bot. Most of the code
written for this jam still lives on in Sir Lancebot, and you can play with it by
using the `.snakes` command. For more information on this event, see [the event
page](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/code-jams/code-jam-1-snakes-bot/)
