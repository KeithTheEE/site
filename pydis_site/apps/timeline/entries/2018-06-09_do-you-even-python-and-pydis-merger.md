At this point in time, there are only two serious Python communities on Discord
- Ours, and one called Do You Even Python. We approach the owners of DYEP with a
bold proposal - let's shut down their community, replace it with links to ours,
and in return we will let their staff join our staff. This gives us a big boost
in members, and eventually leads to @eivl and @Mr. Hemlock joining our Admin
team
