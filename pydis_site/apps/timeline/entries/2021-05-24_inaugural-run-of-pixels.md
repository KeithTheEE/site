Inspired by the subreddit, r/place, Pixels was our collaborative canvas event
held between May 25 to June 14, providing a beginner-friendly API to paint
pixels on a virtual canvas.

Later, we released [a blog
post](https://blog.pythondiscord.com/pixels-summer-2021/) summarizing what
happened, our motives, and some stories from during development.
