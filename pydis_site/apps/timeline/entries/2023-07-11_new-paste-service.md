We migrate over to [pinnwand](https://github.com/supakeen/pinnwand) as the
service that powers our paste bin over at <https://paste.pythondiscord.com/>.
We made the switch as it comes with native light/dark modes, support for
multi-file pastes, additional support for text highlighting languages, and
plus, it's written in Python!
