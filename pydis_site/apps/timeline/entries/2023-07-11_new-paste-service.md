We migrate over to [pinnwand](https://github.com/supakeen/pinnwand) as the
service that powers our paste bin over at
[https://paste.pythondiscord.com/](https://paste.pythondiscord.com). We made the
switch as it comes with native light/dark modes, support for multi-file pastes,
additional support for text highlighting languages, and plus, it's written in
Python!
